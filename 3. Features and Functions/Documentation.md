## Prerequisites

Before deploying the AWS SAM template, you'll need the following:

- An AWS account.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.
- AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI installed.

## Deployment

To deploy the AWS SAM template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cloudcampbd/cloudninja.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd cd cloudninja/3.\ Features\ and\ Functions/
   ```

3. Deploy the SAM template using the following command:

   ```sh
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

   Follow the prompts to provide necessary parameters.

## Template Components

The AWS SAM template creates the following resources:

- **Cognito User Pool**: A user directory that allows you to manage user registration, sign-in, and other user-related features.
- **Cognito User Pool Client**: A client application that interacts with the User Pool for authentication and authorization.
- **Cognito User Pool Domain**: A domain name that provides a user-friendly URL for your User Pool's hosted sign-in and sign-up UI.

## Usage

Once the template is deployed, you can integrate the generated resources into your applications:

1. Use the User Pool and User Pool Client in your application's authentication and authorization flows.
2. Utilize the Hosted UI URL provided in the Outputs section of the CloudFormation stack to provide a seamless user authentication experience.
